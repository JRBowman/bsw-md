# About

We back up our mission by continuously maintaining our technical edge through open source development and filling gaps where technical problems exist today without easy solutions. While maintaining this edge, we produce and share high-quality software **by example** on GitHub - taking the opportunity to expand our public Knowledge Base and share our direct experiences from 'on the frontlines' deeply implementing a software solution or design pattern.

Careful modernization of software systems can yield bountiful benefits - the best software systems are the ones that require zero human intervention and everything is transparently automated. We equip organizations and technical teams with modern application development best practices to build better software, assisting from the whiteboard to the keyboard! 

Our domain expertise covers software of all sizes, scales, and forms - from Windows Server 2003 to Modern Application Development with Containers and Kubernetes. Our passion to solve problems with novel and simple solutions is what drives us! Having worked 'in the trenches' and acted as technical thought leaders, we know too well the challenges and `technical debt` that prevents positive change in software systems and it is our sole purpose now to enable those who have yet to make it to the paradise of Modern Application Development!
