# Welcome to the Community!
We seek to share as much development knowledge as possible on any topic of interest - from .NET to GoLang to Python, we'll be sharing it all!

The _Articles_ section is devoted to helpful / insightful content that _doesn't_ leave any gaps when discussing a topic... when was the last time you read a development blog on something you're trying to do and the author omits _key_ details that leaves you thrashing for hours? We try to ensure that these articles are peer-reviewed to avoid the common pitfalls of assumptions so they can provide the most value for your time!

There's currently no schedule for content releases but that will be updated soon for a steady flow of solid content!

As always, thank you for reading and making the most of the software you develop!
